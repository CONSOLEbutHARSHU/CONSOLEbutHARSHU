**2. Host the File**

You need to host your ToS file so you can share its URL:

- **GitHub:** Commit the file to a public GitHub repository. You can then share the link, e.g.,  
  `https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/blob/main/terms-of-service.md`
- **Website:** If you have a website, upload the file there, e.g.,  
  `https://yourdomain.com/terms-of-service`
- **Pastebin/Gist:** Use a service like Pastebin or GitHub Gist for a quick solution.

**3. Share the URL**

Add the URL to your Discord bot’s help command, website, or Discord server.

**Example:**
```
Terms of Service: https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/blob/main/terms-of-service.md
```

If you’d like, I can help you further customize the ToS text or assist with GitHub/Gist upload instructions. Let me know your preferences!
